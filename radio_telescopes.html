                Radio telescopes provide one of the key windows into the Cosmic Dawn through the spin-flip background generated by hydrogen atoms, which allows us to study the properties of the vast clouds of intergalactic gas – and how that gas is influenced by galaxies. While the spin-flip line has been used many times to map gas in the nearby Universe, it is far more difficult to observe in the Cosmic Dawn, and only one tentative detection has been claimed. However, astronomers are building several new radio telescopes to observe this signal, and we are already using them to learn about the Cosmic Dawn.

                <h1>How do radio telescopes work?</h1>
                <p>
                    A simple <i>radio telescope</i> is likely quite familiar: it is a device to capture <a title="Low-energy electromagnetic radiation with the longest wavelength on the spectrum"><i style="cursor: help;">radio waves</i></a>, just like a  radio antenna or a satellite dish. As with normal telescopes, bigger radio telescopes can collect more light so are more useful for astronomers (and for all of us trying to listen to distant radio transmitters!). However, because radio waves oscillate across relatively large distances (in the case of the measured <a title="when a hydrogen atom’s electron “flips” its spin with respect to the proton’s spin and produces a photon"><i style="cursor:help;">spin-flip background</i></a>, across distances a few meters across), radio telescopes must be very large. In practice, making a single radio telescope able to measure the variations in the spin-flip background is impractical. Fortunately, astronomers have learned to combine the signals from different antennae using a technique called <i>interferometry</i>. This can even allow the signals from several hundred dishes to be combined into one measurement, as the<i> Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</i> (or HERA, which you can learn more about below) is doing in South Africa to measure the spin-flip background.

                <h1>Why is the spin-flip background so hard to observe?</h1>
                <p>
                    There are three principal challenges to observing the spin-flip background, all arising from its low frequencies at Earth. First, the signal appears in the same radio frequency band as radio broadcasts, TV transmissions, and many communications systems. These are far, far stronger than the spin-flip background. Second, the <a title="the galaxy in which our solar system resides"><i style="cursor:help;">Milky Way</i></a> galaxy “glows” at these frequencies thanks to light generated by <a title="High energy particles like protons and electrons that come from mysterious origins outside the solar system"><i style="cursor:help;">cosmic rays</i></a> streaming through the Galaxy. This unavoidable foreground is roughly 10,000 times stronger than the signal from the Cosmic Dawn! Third, the Earth’s <a title="The layer of the earth's atmosphere ionized by solar radiation"><i style="cursor:help;">ionosphere</i></a> affects radio waves as they travel through it. The spin-flip background from the Cosmic Dawn is distorted by the ionosphere, while that from earlier times like the Dark Ages can be blocked completely.

                <h1>How can astronomers overcome these challenges?</h1>
                <p>
                    To decrease <a title="fading or static caused by other radio sources"><i style="cursor:help;">interference</i></a> from our own transmitters, the simplest solution is to build the telescope in an isolated location – astronomers use radio telescopes in the Australian outback and in the desert of South Africa, for example. Alternatively, powerful computers can separate the contamination and allow measurements in the unaffected parts of the radio spectrum. Computers are also essential for tackling the other obstacles. For example, distortions from the ionosphere can be measured in real time and corrected with computers.

                <p>
                    But the most challenging aspect is also unavoidable: the “foreground” from the Milky Way. This is so strong that the current generation of experiments cannot completely overcome the noise, and rather than make images of the sky, astronomers must measure statistics to compare with models. Even that is challenging, as the foregrounds themselves can contaminate statistical measurements as well.. Sifting through these statistics is the primary challenge for existing and future radio measurements of the Cosmic Dawn.

                <h1>What have we learned so far?</h1>
                <p>
                    Although the first efforts to observe the spin-flip background from cosmic structures date back more than 50 years, only in the past decade has our understanding of the signal and computing power advanced far enough to make the observations practical. Despite intense (and ongoing!) efforts, only one experiment has made a tentative detection of the signal. In the winter of 2018, the <i>Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature</i> (EDGES) collaboration presented the first measurement of an “all-sky” spin-flip background. The extreme difficulty of the data analysis means that the measurement needs confirmation, but if that occurs, the surprising nature of the signal means that there is much to be learned about the Cosmic Dawn!

                <p>
                    Several radio telescopes are trying to observe the spin-flip background now. Our team is involved with the <i>Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</i>, or HERA, a large telescope dedicated to observing the Cosmic Dawn. It is now under construction in the Karoo desert of South Africa, and it will eventually be made of more than 300 antennae, each 14 meters across. The HERA collaboration and many others are continuing to improve their analysis procedures, and we hope to make measurements of the Cosmic Dawn in the next few years. Meanwhile, 'all-sky' experiments like EDGES are also continuing to make observations and test for systematic problems. As NASA returns to the Moon, it also offers an excellent platform for these observations, as described on the <a>Lunar Radio Telescopes</a> page.

            <h2>An Interferometer in South Africa</h2>
            <p>
                This movie shows the <i>Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array</i>, or HERA, a large radio telescope in the Karoo Desert of South Africa. HERA is currently one of the premier radio telescopes studying the Cosmic Dawn - but it doesn't look like a single telescope! That is because it is an <i>interferometer</i>: a special kind of observatory - most commonly observing in the radio range - that cleverly combines signals from many different individual telescopes into a more powerful observation.

                <br /><br />These kinds of telescopes use a property of light called <i>interference</i>. Light is composed of waves, or alternating series of crests and troughs. When two light waves are combined, the crests and troughs of each add together. If they line up, the wave becomes stronger, but if the crests of one wave overlap the troughs of another, they cancel each other!

            <h2>How powerful is a single HERA dish?</h2>
            <p>
                Each of HERA's 350 dishes points straight up, collecting the signal from an area about 10 degrees across on the sky (or a total area about 400 times that of the full moon). We often think of telescopes as able to map the fine details across their field of view, but radio telescopes actually have very poor <i>angular resolution</i> - the ability to distinguish features in the signal (in this case, to perhaps identify an ionized bubble during <i>reionization</i>). An eye exam measures the resolving power of your eyes: the smaller the letters you can make out, the better the angular resolution.

                <br /><br />This resolving power depends on both the size of the telescope and the properties of the observed waves. In HERA's case, the crests and troughs of radio waves are large - comparable to the sizes of the radio dishes themselves. On their own, each of the HERA dishes can barely distinguish any of the sky features.

            <h2>How powerful is the entire HERA array?</h2>
            <p>
                However, because the different HERA dishes are in slightly different locations, they receive their signals with slight delays relative to each other - the crests of the waves from each dish are displaced relative to each other. <i>Interferometry</i> is the process of combining the waves from the different dishes and using the interference of the waves to reconstruct the signal from the sky. It allows the combined dishes to behave as a single telescope with a resolving power equivalent to a telescope the size of the entire array!

                <br /><br />During this process, different combinations of dishes probe different parts of the signal. When their waves are added, nearby dishes see a blurry version of the sky, with just slightly more resolving power than a single dish. But dishes with large separations can make out much smaller features on the sky.

                <br /><br />HERA, through combinations of its 350 dishes, can therefore measure the structure of the spin-flip background across a range of scales, from large, obvious features that might be visible even with poor resolving power (like the largest ionized bubbles in the Universe during reionization) to smaller scale features (like density variations across the Universe). This is an enormous computational challenge: there are more than 60,000 pairs of antennae, each of which must be combined at many different frequencies, many times per second!
