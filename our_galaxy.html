                Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a quite typical resident of the Universe today (about 14 billion years after the Big Bang). It’s about average size, with a distinct spiral structure, living in a small group of other galaxies while it grows slowly but steadily. But even a late bloomer like the Milky Way began its growth during the Cosmic Dawn, and astronomers are learning more and more about the earliest phases of its evolution.

                <p>
                    The <i>Milky Way</i> is the galaxy in which we live: a collection of more than one hundred billion stars, most of them in a thin disk orbiting the center of our Galaxy. You may have seen it as a faint band of light stretching across the sky (but only if you live somewhere with dark skies – outside of a city), which is the source of its name. Although it appears as a glow, the faint light in this band is actually the result of the many, many stars arrayed inside the <a title="The thin pancake-like shape of a galaxy which contains most of the stars, star-forming gas clouds, and often a spiral structure."><i style="cursor:help;">disk</i></a>; we see it as a band because the Sun is inside the disk, about two-thirds of the way from the center of the Galaxy.

                <h1>How did the Milky Way form?</h1>
                <p>
                    Like that of most present-day galaxies, the history of the Milky Way stretches back more than thirteen billion years, to the Cosmic Dawn. Galaxies form through the growth of very small seeds, so  only a small fraction of the Milky Way’s stars formed during those earliest phases. Astronomers believe that these rare stars formed in small, early galaxies and globular clusters, which later merged together as the Milky Way grew. But the system acquired most of its mass – and its stars as well – at much later times. During the Cosmic Noon, the Milky Way’s gas settled into a disk, inside which most of those stars formed. The disk grew both through gas flowing onto it from the surrounding medium and through mergers with other (much smaller) galaxies. (Many galaxies grow through mergers with large systems, but astronomers believe the Milky Way has not yet done so.) During these mergers, some of the older stars were ejected into wide orbits and are now part of the galaxy’s halo, and others were mixed into the Milky Way's bulge. Mergers with such small galaxies are continuing, as we will discuss in the next section.

                <p>
                    Although the Milky Way started to form during the Cosmic Dawn, the vast majority of stars in it formed much more recently. But careful searches have revealed several aspects that hold clues to the Cosmic Dawn.

Careful study of these stars has revealed some of the oldest objects in the Milky Way – some stars have even been found to have formed more than thirteen billion years ago! These stars also have far fewer heavier elements than the Sun. Such elements – everything except hydrogen and helium – formed in stars, which then spread them through winds or supernova explosions. The oldest stars we can see may have formed from gas that was only enriched by a single such supernova! Careful study of the abundances of heavy elements in such stars may reveal the nature of the first stars and their supernovae.</li>

(In contrast, the nearest star to the Milky Way is still four light years away!) They are also full of very old stars, more than ten billion years old, but the manner in which they may have formed remains elusive. If most globular clusters formed during the Cosmic Dawn, it is possible that most stars in the early Universe formed in such systems! Further study of the history of these systems will help us to understand their importance during the Cosmic Dawn.

These are tiny galaxies orbiting the Milky Way – destined eventually to be absorbed into it! Some are large enough to be observed directly (such as the Magellanic Clouds, visible from the southern hemisphere), but most have so few stars that they require careful analysis to identify. In these smaller dwarf galaxies, all the stars are quite old – indicating that their star formation turned off many billions of years ago. Heating from reionization may be the reason these systems stopped forming stars, and studying these ancient systems may help us understand how reionization proceeded near the Milky Way.
